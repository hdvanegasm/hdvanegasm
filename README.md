ðŸ˜„ My name is HernÃ¡n DarÃ­o Vanegas Madrigal. I am a Research Engineer at [Hashcloak](https://github.com/hashcloak) in charge of doing research about MPC-related topics. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and Bachelor's degree in Mathematics. I did MSc. in Applied Mathematics at National University of Colombia. I am interested in cryptography and algorithm analysis. Also, I'm proficient in the [MP-SPDZ framework](https://github.com/data61/MP-SPDZ). I have been using this framework to implement algorithms to train machine learning models securely using secure multiparty computation protocols and computing dynamic programming algorithms securely. In general, I am interested in applying abstract mathematic concepts to computer science areas.

ðŸŒ± I'm interested in learning Rust and Go. Also, I'm interested in learning how to implement cryptographic protocols in real-world environments.
