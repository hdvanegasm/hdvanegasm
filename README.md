ðŸ˜„ My name is HernÃ¡n DarÃ­o Vanegas Madrigal. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and Bachelor's degree in Mathematics. I'm currently an MSc. student in Applied Mathematics at National University of Colombia. I am interested in cryptography and algorithm analysis. I'm proficient in the [MP-SPDZ framework](https://github.com/data61/MP-SPDZ). I have been using this framework to implement algorithms to train machine learning models securely using secure multiparty computation protocols. As an example, here in my GitHub you can find different methods to train Support Vector Machines using MP-SPDZ. In general, I am interested in applying abstract mathematic concepts to computer science areas.

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning secure multi-party computation and its applications to machine learning and genomics algorithms. Also, I'm interested in learning Rust.
