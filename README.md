### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ˜„ My name is HernÃ¡n DarÃ­o Vanegas. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and I am currently doing a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics. I am interested in algorithm analysis and cryptography. In general, I am interested in applying abstract mathematic concepts to computer science areas.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Universidad Nacional de Colombia as a Auxiliary Student. Specifically, I am helping to improve the key online courses of the university like Programming Fundamentals in Python 3.

ğŸŒ± I am currently learning secure multi-party computation and its applications to machine learning.
